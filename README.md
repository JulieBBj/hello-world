# hello-world

this is the readme.md-file, and this is my first commit. learning to use branches and then merging them back into the master-file. scary as it might seem i hope i will manage, and you will too! 

i want to try to use the desktop version of git on my computer locally, and see how that integrates, so this edit is from that
